	  This software is an implementation of the Precision Time
	  Protocol (PTP) according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux.
	  The dual design goals are to provide a robust implementation
	  of the standard and to use the most relevant and modern
	  Application Programming Interfaces (API) offered by the
	  Linux kernel. Supporting legacy APIs and other platforms
	  is not a goal.
